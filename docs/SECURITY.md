# Security notes and findings

Tests passing is not an audit. This system will hold user principal; an independent adversarial review
is required before it is advertised or funded. Tools run in this job: `forge build`, `forge test`
(unit, fuzz, invariants), `forge fmt`, forge's built-in lints. Slither and Mythril were not available
here; the code was written around Slither's rejection detectors (no `selfdestruct`, `transferFrom`
only from `msg.sender`, no initializers/upgrades, no uninitialized storage pointers, no Yul shifts, no
`abi.encodePacked` of dynamic values).

## Fixed during development

| # | Finding | Fix | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `claim()` harvested rewards into a pending bucket but did not clear it, so a second `claim()` would pay again from `rewardReserve` (draining other users' rewards). | `_pendingOf[msg.sender] = 0` before paying. | `test_rewardsAccrueProRataAndClaimIsIndependentOfPrincipal` ("nothing twice"), invariant `invariant_farmBalanceCoversPrincipal` |
| 2 | Farm constructor read `controller.token()`; the token is bound after launch, so the farm cached the zero address, and the launch rehearses constructors on an empty chain where the call reverts. | `cheese()` is read lazily from the controller; constructors touch no contract. | `test_constructorsNeedNoLiveContracts`, all reward tests |
| 3 | `pendingRewards()` ignored Squeek blocks certified since the last checkpoint, under-reporting to the website. | `previewPoolEmission()` includes the unsynced checkpoint. | `test_rewardsAccrueProRataAndClaimIsIndependentOfPrincipal` |

| # | Severity | Finding | Fix | Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | high | A 1-wei first deposit (1000 shares) made `accRewardPerShare` grow by `amount × 1e36 / 1000` per pull; later `shares × acc` products overflowed, so ordinary deposits reverted for good. | Every `shares × acc / 1e36` is a 512-bit `Math.mulDiv`. | `test_oneWeiFirstDepositorCannotBrickLaterDeposits`, `invariant_userActionsNeverRevertUnexpectedly` |
| 5 | high | Floored reward debts let the accounts' entitlements sum a wei above `rewardReserve`; the last claimer reverted, permanently once emission had completed. | Debts round up (`_debtFor`), harvests floor and clamp at zero, so the sum never exceeds the reserve; `claim` additionally pays `min(pending, reserve)` and keeps the rest pending instead of reverting. | `test_everyAccountCanClaimAfterEmissionEnds`, `test_claimNeverRevertsOnReserveShortfall`, `invariant_entitlementsNeverExceedReserve` |
| 6 | high | `withdraw` pushed the Treasury's share with a reverting call, so a Treasury that refuses ETH (or tokens) blocked every withdrawal, irrecoverably after `renounceOwnership`. | The Treasury push is a non-reverting call with a 100k gas stipend; on failure the amount is credited to `treasuryOwed` and anyone can `payTreasury()` later. The withdrawer's 85% never depends on the Treasury. | `test_revertingTreasuryNeverBlocksWithdrawalEvenWithoutAnOwner`, `test_deferredTreasuryShareIsPaidOnceTheTreasuryCanReceive`, `test_gasBurningOrReceiverlessTreasuryIsDeferredToo`, `test_erc20FarmDefersTreasuryShareTheTokenRefusesToDeliver` |
| 7 | medium | Deposits were accepted while SqueekCore was unreadable or regressed, so blocks certified before the deposit were later spread over the new shares. | `pullRewards` returns `synced`; `_deposit` reverts with `SyncRequired` unless the sync succeeded. Withdrawals and claims stay best-effort. | `test_depositWaitsForSyncWhileWithdrawAndClaimDoNot`, `test_firstDepositDuringOutageCannotInheritForfeitableEmission` |
| 8 | medium | `pauseEmissions` did not checkpoint first, so a staker exiting during the pause lost the blocks certified before it, which could then be forfeited. | `pauseEmissions` calls `_sync()` (best effort) before setting the flag. | `test_pausePricesBlocksCertifiedBeforeItForThoseStakedThen`, `test_pauseStillWorksWhenCoreIsUnavailable` |
| 9 | medium | `try/catch` does not cover return data that fails to decode or a target without code, so a SqueekCore upgrade that changed a struct would revert every withdraw and claim. | SqueekCore is read through raw `staticcall`s; the payload must have the exact static size and decode through `this.decode*` inside `try/catch`; any failure is "unavailable". | `test_undecodableCoreStateIsUnavailableNotARevert`, `test_coreWithoutCodeIsUnavailableNotARevert`, `test_undecodableRoundPageDelaysAnchorWithoutRevert`, `test_activateTreatsUndecodableConfigurationAsUnavailable` |
| 10 | low | `batchSetPoolWeights` with a repeated id applied the two passes, not the input order. | Duplicate ids revert with `DuplicatePoolId`. | `test_batchRejectsDuplicatePoolIds` |
| 11 | low | When the last real shares left, the part of retained fees attributable to the virtual shares stayed in `totalAssets` with no shares to reach it. | With `totalShares == 0` the whole remaining reserve goes to the Treasury with the fee; the farm restarts at the initial price. | `test_emptyFarmSweepsResidualRetainedFeeToTreasury`, `test_lastDepositorWithdrawalSendsFull15ToTreasury` |
| 12 | low | The deploy script's hand-over left the deployer as guardian. | `handOver` calls `setGuardian(owner)` first. | `test_wireAndHandOver` |

## Fixed after independent review (revision 2)

| # | Severity | Finding | Fix | Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | medium | The three SqueekCore reads used Solidity's `addr.staticcall(...)`, which copies the callee's whole return data with the 1/64 of gas the caller keeps (EIP-150). A Core upgrade that burned the forwarded gas and returned 2 MiB made every withdraw, claim and the emergency pause run out of gas, locking all principal. | `_boundedStaticcall` calls with no output buffer, checks `returndatasize()` against the expected size (exact for `state`/`configuration`, 4 KiB for `roundPage`) and only then copies. An oversized payload reads as unavailable with an `OversizedReturnData(size, max)` reason. | `test_returnBombCoreDoesNotBlockExitsOrPause`, `test_oversizedRoundPageDelaysAnchorWithoutRevert` |
| 14 | low | `previewPoolEmission` floored the settled-but-unpulled and the unsynced parts separately, so `pendingRewards` read up to 1 wei below what `claim` paid; the strict handler in `test/Invariants.t.sol` could flag it. | The preview adds the unsynced increment to the per-point delta first and floors once, exactly as `_sync` + `_settle` do. | `test_pendingRewardsMatchesClaimExactlyWithUnsyncedBlocks`, `invariant_userActionsNeverRevertUnexpectedly` |
| 15 | low | Nothing stated that the sIMD asset must be non-rebasing; the farm counts principal from amounts received, so a rebasing token would strand the last withdrawers (negative) or expose depositors' yield to `skimSurplus` (positive). | Documented at `setAsset`, in the README's after-launch step and in item 6 below. The accounting is unchanged (balance-based accounting for a rebasing asset would be a scope change). | n/a (documentation) |
| 16 | info | README and this file said "the owner cannot mint"; the owner can register any contract answering `emissionController()`/`registered()` as a pool and route future emission to it. | Wording corrected: the owner cannot mint directly but can direct future emission to any pool it registers (prospective, schedule-bounded, no principal or accrued rewards). | `test_addPoolRejectsFarmOfAnotherController` (what `addPool` checks) |

## Trust assumptions (by design, requested by the brief)

* **Owner** can reallocate future emission between pools (including to 0), pause emissions (which also
  closes deposits), pause a farm's deposits, change the Treasury, and skim donated surplus to it. The
  owner cannot mint directly, change fees, or move principal or accrued rewards. The owner *can* direct
  future emission to any contract it registers as a pool (`addPool` only checks that the candidate
  points back at the controller and is not yet registered), including one it controls, by moving
  weights to it; this is prospective, bounded by the SQK schedule and the mining allowance, and
  touches no principal or already accrued rewards. It is the brief's "add pools, adjust future
  allocation" power, so a multisig or timelock as owner is the mitigation; `Ownable2Step` prevents
  accidental loss of ownership.
* **Guardian** can only pause emissions.
* **Squeekchain** is the sole emission oracle. Its Reporter and admin Timelock control what gets
  certified; a malicious or buggy settlement would mis-price CHEESE in the same way it mis-prices SQK.
  The controller never substitutes zero progress and never backdates; a height regression is ignored and
  logged.
* **Treasury** receives the 1% (or full 15%) Hamster Bite share. A Treasury that cannot receive
  (reverts, no `receive`, burns the 100k stipend, token refuses it) never blocks withdrawals: its share
  is deferred to `treasuryOwed` and delivered by `payTreasury()` once a receiving Treasury is set
  (tested). Use a plain EOA or a Safe anyway, so the share arrives directly.

## Residual risks and recommendations

1. **Forfeited emission.** Emission accrued while a farm has no stakers is forfeited (never minted). This
   is intentional (no retroactive rewards) but means total CHEESE issuance can fall below SQK's if a pool
   sits empty. Operators should set an empty pool's weight to 0 (moving its points to the reserve) or
   seed it. An alternative design routes forfeited emission to the Treasury; it is a one-line change in
   `pullRewards` and should be a product decision.
2. **Pause semantics.** The pause prices the blocks certified before it (best effort; if SqueekCore is
   unreadable at that moment those blocks are caught up at unpause). Pause stops pricing but not the
   Squeek clock; unpausing emits the blocks certified *during* the pause to whoever holds shares then.
   Deposits are closed while paused so nobody new can be added, but existing depositors who withdraw
   during a pause forgo that catch-up. Documented; acceptable for an emergency tool.
3. **sIMD asset unset at launch.** Until `setAsset` is called, the sIMD pool's 200 points accrue and are
   forfeited at the first pull. Set the asset before `activate()`.
4. **Reward dust.** `amount × 1e36 / totalShares` floors and each account's debt rounds up, so an account
   can lose at most 1 wei per share change; dust stays in `rewardReserve` unclaimable. Never affects
   principal, and the sum of entitlements never exceeds the reserve (invariant-tested).
5. **Virtual offset.** With 1e3 virtual shares and 1 virtual asset, a first deposit of 1 wei is possible
   and the retained-fee mechanic lets a griefer raise assets-per-share by paying 15% per cycle. Tests show
   a later depositor keeps ~100% of value; the attack is uneconomic but the first deposit on each farm
   should still be made by the team. While the griefer's last share remains, a deposit too small for one
   share reverts with `ZeroShares`; once every share leaves, the residual goes to the Treasury and the
   price resets. A 1-wei first depositor alone in a farm collects that pool's whole emission for as long
   as nobody else deposits; that is the intended "whoever is staked earns" rule, not a loss to others.
6. **Owner-set addresses are checked only for non-zero** (Treasury, guardian) or for code (sIMD asset).
   A wrong sIMD address cannot be corrected (write-once); verify before calling. **sIMD must be a
   static-balance (non-rebasing) ERC-20.** The farms track principal in `totalAssets` from the amounts
   they receive, never from `balanceOf`, which is what defeats donation inflation but assumes balances
   only change through the farm's own transfers. With a negatively rebasing token the farm would
   overstate its holdings, pay early withdrawers from later depositors' tokens and fail the last
   withdrawals; with a positively rebasing one the growth shows as `surplus()` and `skimSurplus()` would
   send depositors' yield to the Treasury. Fee-on-transfer tokens are fine (received amounts are
   measured). If the real sIMD rebases, do not call `setAsset`; a balance-based or wrapper farm is a
   scope decision for the requester.
7. **Gas of `claim`/`deposit`.** Each user action may perform a checkpoint and mint. The original
   Cancun gas figures are obsolete for Amsterdam. Use isolated simulation and current RPC estimates;
   a keeper checkpoint does not eliminate per-farm mint and storage costs.
8. **Squeekchain ABI change.** The proxies may be upgraded by their admin Timelock. A breaking change
   (another return size, undecodable data, code removed, a payload of any size after burning the
   forwarded gas) makes `checkpoint()` return `false` and leaves withdrawals, claims, views and the
   pause working (tested with reverting, gas-burning and 2 MiB return-bomb Cores); deposits wait. A
   Core call is now capped at 500,000 gas rather than forwarding 63/64 of the caller's remaining gas.
   Supply adequate transaction gas: the cold-state regression matrix verifies exits and claims with
   3,000,000-gas subcalls across all three farms. A change that keeps the same size and field
   types but another meaning cannot be detected on chain and would mis-price emission until the owner
   pauses. In both cases a new controller would be required. The controller's `squeekCore` is immutable
   by design (no re-pointing attack surface).
9. **Deferred Treasury share.** `treasuryOwed` is reserved against `skimSurplus` and paid only to the
   Treasury configured at `payTreasury()` time; a wrong Treasury that *can* receive is paid directly,
   so verify the address before `setTreasury`.

10. **Corrected ERC20 Treasury boundary.** The self-only `transferTreasuryToken` helper executes
    inside a 500,000-gas frame. Only a successful call to a contract returning no bytes or exactly one
    canonical true word succeeds. False, malformed, oversized, reverting and gas-exhausting calls
    revert that frame, including token balance changes. The caller then defers the fee. This is not a
    guarantee for malicious or rebasing assets; the principal transfer must still behave correctly.

11. **Outage reward semantics are unchanged.** Accounted/pulled rewards survive withdrawal and remain
    claimable. A failed Core read does not advance the certified cursor or invent emission. Deposits
    and weight changes wait for synchronization. Emission not yet readable is priced on recovery
    against the then-current eligible shares; an emptied pool forfeits its unpulled share before a new
    deposit. The correction does not introduce historical user-share snapshots or promise unavailable
    emission to an already-exited user. This limitation must remain visible to users.

## Launch revision: reviewer findings fixed in `CheeseFarm`

| # | Finding | Fix | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | A stake deposited just before a dominant exit (same block, no minimum, no lock) inherited the retained 14% and left with 85% of it; the Treasury received 0.31 ETH instead of 1.5 ETH on a 10 ETH sole-staker exit. | The retained share is capped at 15/85 of the assets backing the remaining shares, i.e. what those shares will themselves pay the Treasury on exit; the excess goes to the Treasury at once. A zero-duration stake can never net more than its own Hamster Bite, whatever block it arrived in. | `test/LaunchFindings.t.sol` (front-run, honest remaining stakers, cap formula, fuzz), `testFuzz_hamsterBiteExactSplit`, `testFuzz_independentWithdrawalConservation` |
| R2 | Emission arrives per certification and was split over the shares present at pull time, so a deposit mined just ahead of the Reporter's settle tx earned a full pro-rata share of the round for a 15% exit fee. | Shares deposited into a farm that already has stakers are `waiting` until the next pull that prices new Squeek blocks (`controller.emissionPerPoint()` moved); chunks are spread over `activeShares` only. The first stake into an empty farm earns immediately. Withdrawals burn waiting shares first and are never delayed. | `test/LaunchFindings.t.sol` (settle front-run, activation, forfeited pull, empty farm, burn order, view/claim fuzz) |

Residual, inherent to redistributing a fee to remaining stakers and not reported: a
single staker who splits their own exit into many withdrawals recycles the retained
share into their own remaining position (the cap does not bind when the withdrawer's
own remaining stake is large). Only the Treasury's 1% and the final exit's full 15%
are guaranteed against a self-dealing whale.
